    "neighborhood_overview": "Camberwell is a great area of London, green and calm but with lots of independent cafes and pubs. There is an established art college so it's a nice bohemian vibe in this historically Afro-Caribbean neighbourhood, without it being sickeningly hipster.",
    "notes": "We have three bathrooms and we're really proud of this fact, just wanted to let you know.",
    "transit": "Camberwell doesn't have a tube BUT  the bus links to Vauxhall/Oval/Elephant and Castle/ Anywhere are super sweet and the flat is a 15min walk from Denmark Hill Overground Station and Loughborough Junction real train station. A great base in south London for someone for a few weeks.",
    "access": "You'd have your own keys. The room is in a flatshare with three wonderful and friendly  housemates. The flat is on two floors - on the ground floor, there is a living room and two bedrooms. Next door is a kitchen, with all the typical kitchen amenities you would expect.",
    "interaction": "We'd welcome you into our home! You'd be treated exactly like a normal flatmate but excused the chores!  My flat mates are Chris (a boy) who is very glamourous, clever and works for a think tank, Octavia (a girl) who is also very glamourous and clever and is a copywriter and Sequoia (a girl) who is gorgeous and a very talented photographer. We're all in our 20s and between the three of them speak: French, German and Spanish. We're a very happy house, making each other laugh and dinner from time to time, but  we all have different jobs and keep different hours so you wouldn't be forced to socialise on a week night if you didn't want to.",
    "house_rules": "We basically would like people to have a nice time. We all like the house looking good and the kitchen being clean, but understand if someone is in a rush in the morning then their plate being out is not the end of the world. We regularly sit around the wobbly kitchen table and chat in the evenings, which is nice because we all have different jobs and friendship groups.",

I am a big fan of Masterchef ! \r\n\r\nAs soon as I moved to the area, I fell in love with Greenwich. Next to Deptford Bridge DLR station, 15min to Canary Wharf or London Bridge, 25min to Bank. Here is just 8-10min walk to historic Greenwich town centre. With train only 15min to London Bridge or Canary Wharf.  I enjoy every inch of good that Greenwich offers, walking in Greenwich park in a nice day, having coffee with my friends in Greenwich market or cycling around Thames Riverside...\r\n\r\nWelcome you to London.  I am looking forward to meeting new friends from Airbnb.",

If this is not possible then we will make sure that the house manual states everything our guests need to know. Beautiful Neighbourhood situated in SE London. We are lucky to be situated in the centre of both Peckham and Camberwell. Both areas are great for different things and interests - if you are looking for a quiet and slightly more residential area then head down to Camberwell for a delicious coffee and walk around Ruskin park...

A lot of the streets are cycling streets, so there are not that many cars around. If you have some time to just take a walk around the area, you will forget about the fact that you are in one of Europe's biggest capitals. Nevertheless the lively parts of Shoreditch with interesting restaurants, bars and stores are all in walking distance and easy to get to.  At the weekends you can get fresh flowers on Columbia Road or try the diverse food stands at broadway market, selling everything from bacon to beans. On lazy days you can just walk down the road to the canal, have a coffee at one of the lovely cafes and gaze on the water. Whatever you are looking for, you will definitely find it in this area.

The Victoria and Piccadilly lines at Finsbury Park are a 15 minute bus ride away from a stop just outside the Close. If you're exploring London on Public Transport, you'll only need a Zones 1&2 pass. - Other Things to Note : As mentioned, there are train tracks at the rear.

Clapton is a rapidly up and coming area, with a range of unique bars and eateries and the gourmet Sunday food markets on Chatsworth Road nearby. Whether you want a great breakfast, to stay out partying, do a bit of boutique shopping, or have a serene walk in the nature reserve and admire the Galloway Band Cattle, it's all here.  Not many flats in Zone 2 have such easy access to acres of green space. I love running, and being right on the towpath next to the river means I can run for hours without ever crossing a road. Lea Valley Ice Rink and Riding Centre are just a short walk away. These facilities, with the sights, shopping, theatres and  museums of central London less than half an hour away make our neighbourhood pretty special. The exciting shopping and nightlife of Dalston and Shoreditch are just a short bus ride away, and the buses run all night! It is a truly unique London experience.

Route 253 and 254 are 7 mins walk away and will take you into central London, or for a quicker journey you can hop off and switch to the tube at Manor House (Piccadilly Line) or Bethnal Green (Central Line) after a 10 minute journey on the bus. From the airports, Stansted is less than an hour away, with the Stansted Express taking you to Liverpool Street in 47 mins, and the train from Liverpool Street to Clapton a 12 minute journey. By car, the journey takes 40 minutes. Heathrow is easily reachable via the Piccadilly Line from Manor House, driving will take about 90 minutes, depending on the time of day.",

There are supermarkets, ethnic markets, pubs, bars and some great, inexpensive restaurants, including South Asian, Lebanese, Italian, Spanish, Moroccan and the odd British. We're also not far from St George's hospital should anything unexpected occur!",
    "notes": "The house was built around a century ago, but rest assured, plenty of improvements have taken place since then. On a quiet and desirable street it offers easy access to the wide open spaces of Tooting Commons, local shops and a sub 10 minute walk to the underground stations.  For fitness enthusiasts, we have the athletics track, the famous Lido, tennis courts, football pitches and plenty of space to go running in the local vicinity.",
    "transit": "Local buses include the 319, the 249, the 219, the 155, the 355; taking you to Chelsea, Battersea, Clapham, Brixton and Elephant & Castle.  In under ten minutes you can walk to either Tooting Bec/Broadway stations on the Northern line of the Underground. One stop on is Balham station, which links to the overground train system taking you to Clapham Junction or Victoria. A 15 minute amble will take you to Tooting Rail station, where you can get into central London and beyond. Parking is available but permits are required Mon-Fri 9.30am - 4.30 pm.",

We like to get off the beaten track and discover places for ourselves instead of just ticking off the main tourist sights (though we do like to do that too). Our most recent travel destinations have been to Lisbon, Berlin and the Arcachon region of France.\r\n\r\nAt home, we love cooking for friends, camping and going to festivals. \r\n\r\nWe hope you will enjoy staying in our home and that you feel comfortable and at ease.

    "neighborhood_overview": "The immediate local area is very vibrant, De Beauvoir village is a real community, it boasts gorgeous cafes, restaurants, a park, a pretty square, bars, a deli, an award winning garden centre, a fantastic Indian takeaway (next door), and the wider local area of Dalston is full of more of the same, a very vibrant, creative, young area.",
    "notes": "The studio is also available for day rentals for photography, film, rehearsals, courses & workshops and more. Please contact me for prices and more information.",
    "transit": "Public transport is fantastic, there are a plethora of local bus services and we are served by 3 local overground stations with trains running every 5 minutes. Dalston Kingsland Station is a 10 minute walk and Dalston Junction and Haggerston Stations are about a 7 or 8 minutes from the studio at a reasonable pace.",

    "interaction": "As your host I will guarantee  you a warm friendly welcome and will happily spend time to settle you in and help you decide on how best to enjoy what Dalston has to offer.",
    "house_rules": "This studio stay is best suited for people who either love yoga and want to join in most classes, or who are busy and are out of the studio most of the time. Due to the layout of the studio, whilst class is on you will need to either join in, stay 'very' quietly in your room, or be out, you will not be able to access the kitchen, bathroom or main studio. Classes are daily and we can run up to 20 classes per week occasionally more. I can send you the timetable on request. Things to note about the studio: This is not high spec luxury living, it is quirky, open plan, creative, warehouse living, suitable for animal and yoga lovers only. Neither of the 2 inbuilt box rooms are properly soundproofed so this space is not ideal for very light sleepers. Whilst class is on, if you choose to stay in your room silence is requested so as not to disturb the class. I ask that guests are respectful, kind and tolerant of the animals. The studio is not suitable for people with cat or dog allergies. The s",

If it's by the window then it's for the house - enjoy! \n\nWe love to travel, we love music and the outdoors... but not camping... We also love the comfort of a bed and a few pillows.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "It\u2019s impossible to think of Parsons Green without Sloane Rangers springing to mind. After all, it\u2019s just down the road from Chelsea and a local pub, The White Horse, is known as the Sloaney Pony on account of the posh types that drink there. Many of the cast of Made In Chelsea have been spotted in the area at some point, and pinstripe shirts far outnumber baseball caps. Parsons Green is actually part of Fulham, rather than Chelsea, and lies between Fulham Road and New Kings Road. With great bars and restaurants, bijou stores and a Sunday farmers\u2019 market, it manages to squeeze a lot into its relatively compact area. It has the ambience of a smart village in the heart of London. On a late Sunday morning, you\u2019re just as likely to see families sipping lattes and baby-cinos outside cafes as you are to find Hooray Henrys trying to cure hangovers with Bloody Marys. Even the chains are upmarket \u2013 there\u2019s a Little Waitrose, Space NK and Cote Brasserie, plus a healthy cluster of independents. Go",

This is a four bedroom house, of which you will have access to two bedrooms and all facilities, including: living area; garden; kitchen; bathroom; and toilet My housemate, Tom, and I will be living in the house at he same time.

This area is famous for London's finest Asian & international restaurants, we will leave some recommendations in the guide. Whitechapel and surrounding areas are very vibrant - with coffee shops, bars, restaurants, pubs clubs and vintage shops available. You are moments from Spitalfields market and the trendy Brick Lane, and a very short walking distance from Shoreditch High Street (15 min) Aldgate Station (10 min) and Liverpool Street Station (15 min) and a large variety of galleries, clubs, cocktail bars, etc.  Also Hoxton Square, Old Street and Bethnal Green station are no more than 20 min walking from the property. From the apartment you can reach most tourist attractions within 15-20 minutes by buses/tubes/trains and walking. It really is  a perfect apartment to get to know Central London, as both a tourist and a local.",

After all, it\u2019s just down the road from Chelsea and a local pub, The White Horse, is known as the Sloaney Pony on account of the posh types that drink there. Many of the cast of Made In Chelsea have been spotted in the area at some point, and pinstripe shirts far outnumber baseball caps. Parsons Green is actually part of Fulham, rather than Chelsea, and lies between Fulham Road and New Kings Road. With great bars and restaurants, bijou stores and a Sunday farmers\u2019 market, it manages to squeeze a lot into its relatively compact area. It has the ambience of a smart village in the heart of London. On a late Sunday morning, you\u2019re just as likely to see families sipping lattes and baby-cinos outside cafes as you are to find Hooray Henrys trying to cure hangovers with Bloody Marys. Even the chains are upmarket \u2013 there\u2019s a Little Waitrose, Space NK and Cote Brasserie, plus a healthy cluster of independents. Go",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The house is located on one of the most beautiful streets in Brixton.  With a fabulous local pub - The Elm Park Tavern 50 meters away, just down our street - where there's also a convenience store. Just a minute's walk down Brixton Hill and you'll land at The White Horse - pretty much the best place to enjoy a Friday or Saturday night in London - and it's free to get in. There are tons of other brilliant nightspots within a stone's throw - but we hardly ever go anywhere else - and you can dance until 4am. For those with energy, there's plenty to do after that of course, with clubs and house parties going well into the next day.  Brixton is the best place to live in London. It's got a massively exciting vibe, beautiful living spaces, amazing restaurants and the coolest clubs and bars - all within walking distance.  You can get to central london in less than 10 mins for sightseeing - or access anywhere at all from the amazing underground network. But at night, you can go out, meet amazin",

    "transit": "Brixton Underground is just a couple of minutes down the hill.  Brixton village is a minutes walk from there. From the underground you can get to Victoria in 7 minutes, London Bridge in 8, Oxford Circus in 10, Kings Cross/Euston/St Pancras in 12 or Paddington in 19.  Tubes and busses come literally every minute now. And you can use any debit card if you have a CONNECT sign. Or buy an oyster card from the local shop.  There's a bus stop 30 seconds from the house, and more than 40 pass every hour. All will take you into different parts of London, or ferry you to the centre of Brixton, at the underground, in seconds (which is fastest for heading into central London ). Once you've taken a few (tubes or busses) the rest are free - if you stay within Zones 1 and 2.  On foot, Brockwell park is 3 minutes walk. And it's a lovely walk across it to get to Herne Hill or Dulwich in 10-15, two lovely quiet neighbourhoods where there are more nice places to eat and drink. You can also walk to Clapham",
    "access": "Guests can use the whole house and garden and any of the facilities - including the washer/dryer, and entertainment system.  The 1st floor bathroom is shared with my best friend Courage, who's very friendly, and has a bedroom on a separate floor.  The downstairs lounge, diner, kitchen and private garden are all for use with whoever is staying.  in the kitchen, you can use all utensils and kitchen supplies, and we can give you a food cupboard if you want to stay a while:)",
    "interaction": "Courage lives in and looks after the house. He's  very easy going, and will be happy to show you the cool places to go in Brixton. Any questions/recommendations about the house, area, transport etc in advance, I can help you with by phone or email. I'm living in Denmark at the moment so on a similar time zone.",

We won't try that again. Now we have a baby and a lovely apartment in Aarhus, Denmark:)   \r\n\r\nOur house in Brixton (London) is a very special place. I bought it as a ruin, 15 years ago, and spent 8 years rebuilding it. I took the roof off, all the floors up and every wall except the two party walls down to the ground. I had lots of fun with it, cutting holes and letting light into unexpected places and and it's now a space that makes me smile whenever I'm in it. I hope it will make you smile also.",

Located in vibrant Hackney, with an excellent arts and music scene, there's tonnes to do here.

You certainly won't be short of things to do in Hackney! Many of our favourite London spots are extremely close by. London Fields with its Broadway Market is a short walk away, the canal offers a wonderful walk through the East side of London and offers an abundance of breweries and restaurants to break up your walk. Columbia Road Flower on a Sunday is a must see and only a short bus journey away, as is all the great nightlife on offer in Shoreditch and Hoxton. There is no better place than Hackney.",

    "summary": "Come stay in one of two lovely first-floor double bedrooms available in my three-bed apartment located on a beautiful, quiet road of Victorian terraces, next to Burgess Park and just down the road from vibrant, hipster Peckham & foodie Camberwell Green.  Just renovated to a luxurious level (underfloor heating, high-speed internet to all rooms, NEST thermostat, new carpets, designer Italian kitchen, new bathrooms, new windows, juliet balcony, soundproofing, new paint)! You will fall in love!",
    "space": "The room is lovely and was recently refurbished and painted a beautiful shade of white, with lovely dark detailing on the woodwork and newly made double glazed timber sash windows. This is not your average rental, but rather a home, and a labour of love. Having recently refurbished over the last 6 months, I have chosen and designed every detail of the interior. That means a very high level of finish, but also attention to how it all works - heated mirrors in the bathrooms, high-speed internet ports in all rooms, luxury Samsung oven, fully integrated designer Italian made kitchen, and induction hobs, and fully smart lighting (every room has multiple dimmers, all controllable via iphone or intelligent wall switches).",

    "neighborhood_overview": "On one side we have Camberwell, which is incredibly for foodies with a cornucopia of great restaurants & welcoming pubs and friendly locals. On the other we have Peckham, which is one of the best night spots in town.",
    "notes": "Please note I have some lovely builders putting the finishing touches to the flat below. They are on the painting stage, so shouldn't make too much noise, but will be active normally from 9-6 for the next two weeks (scheduled to finish mid-October)",
    "transit": "If you're lucky enough / crazy enough to be travelling by car in London, you can park it in the road for free. Otherwise bikes and feet are the best way to navigate the local area, with 15-minute buses to take you to the nearest travel terminus (Elephant & Castle) if you're venturing into the centre of town to explore everything the city has to offer. Uber cabs are also a really great and pretty inexpensive option if buses aren't for you.",
    "access": "Please just make yourself at home. Feel free to use the laundry facilities, the bath, the lounge and the lovely designer Italian kitchen.",
    "interaction": "I've lived in London for nearly ten years now, so can claim to be an adopted Londoner! If you want insider tips on getting about town, what to see that's not on the tourist trail, where the locals go to drink, and where to get the best burgers or fish and chips, just let me know. I love sharing this local knowledge and meeting folk from around the world - and this is one of the reasons I'm so keen to Airbnb my spare rooms. I am out at work during the days, as an advertising exec, and am often out in the evenings, but when I'm around you'll find the atmosphere really warm and friendly.",
    "house_rules": "You're absolutely free to smoke in the garden, but please not in the room, the next guest probably won't thank you. Please save those Tina Turner renditions for London's karaoke bars, but otherwise feel free to treat the place as your home away from home.",

I love to laugh with old friends and make new ones. I love live music, good food, design, art and travel. I love to explore the city and travel the world whenever I can. I am also passionate about learning languages and have picked up French, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese along the way. \r\n\r\nOn my wide-ranging travels I have stayed at a lot of hostels and home stays and have always been able to muck in, make new friends and enjoy the vibe. I also have a regular stream of international friends coming to use my place as a base. As a host I look forward to giving something back to the international community.\r\n\r\n5 things I can't live without? Music. Books. Laughter. My camera. Oh, and great food!",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Balham is pretty  relaxed, some say bohemian!  It has great supermarkets  including Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Lidls, which are open from 7am - 11pm (except Sundays), a large organic store, lots of upcoming trendy breakfast cafes, quirky boutique shops, a daily local fruit and veg market, and lots of great low-average priced restaurants catering for a wide range of tastes - Italian, French, Thai, Indian, Sri Lankan, Vietnamese,  Nepalese,  Lebanese, Middle Eastern,  and modern British, as well as fast food places, including fish & chips, kebabs, McDonalds and Nandos and home delivery services; A bus stop away is Tooting with some of the best South Indian food places  in London, or head to Brixton for some authentic  Caribbean food, including jerk chicken, curry goat or rice and peas!  Balham has some good pubs, including The Bedford which hosts the famous comedy club - The Banana Caberet, and live folk/blues  music; for film lovers, we're   within 10 minutes of local cinemas at Clapham",
    "notes": "THIS LISTING IS FOR FEMALE GUESTS ONLY. I was unable to respond to the comments posted by a long stay guest in Dec 2015 as I was on holiday . To reassure you,  please see the comments by  other reviewers and judge  whether this single negative review reflects more on the guest's personality  or the host. Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries linked to any reviewer's comments.",
    "transit": "The flat is very convenient to public transport , and is 20 - 30  minutes door-door to Waterloo and the South Bank, Oxford Street, and the National museums,  art galleries and theatres.  Local minicab services are plenty or London Black cabs are parked at the local train station. There is a good Zipcar car rental service in the area.  For day trips, Balham,  \"the gateway to the South,\"  is within easy access to the trendy seaside resort of  Brighton, and the  historic sights of  Portsmouth and Winchester.  Direct trains stop at Victoria, and it's easy to get to Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports,  and St Pancras Eurostar - just drop me a line and I'll send you directions on booking. If you have a car/motorbike, there is metered street parking and you can get 1-day  parking permits from the local Balham library.",
    "access": "Clean linen, allergy mattress protector and towels will be provided. Please help yourself to tea, coffee and sugar.  For breakfast,  there are plenty of good breakfast/brunch cafes, coffee shops and restaurants within 5 minutes of the flat.  The kitchen is available for microwave meals only but food/fridge or freezer storage is no longer provided after a poor experience with a long stay guest in December 2015. The electricity sockets are 3 square pin  but a travel adaptor  is available.  Guidebooks about London, including London walks and information about cultural events at our museums, art galleries and theatres   are readily available in the flat. This is a residential house and all common areas are shared with myself; you are welcome to use the patio garden and TV/ DVD/ipod player. The flat has gas central heating in all rooms except the kitchen.",
    "interaction": "I enjoy having people over to stay and making guests feel welcomed,  relaxed and comfortable.  During the day, I'm pretty busy and I often work from home. I'm more than happy to chat and offer any help, but I'll generally  leave you to get on with your stuff unless you wish otherwise.",
    "house_rules": "No smoking indoors, but no problem if you wish to smoke occasionally  in the back garden. This is a residential home so please  be mindful of energy wastage and just turn off  lights when you are not using, and come in quietly if you're out late. That said, you're  free to come and go as you wish.  No additional guests without prior consent. Not really rules, but I'd really appreciate if you would treat the flat with respect  and keep everything clean, tidy and as you found it  - many thanks.",

This is not your average rental, but rather a home, and a labour of love. Having recently refurbished over the last 6 months, I have chosen and designed every detail of the interior. That means a very high level of finish, but also attention to how it all works - heated mirrors in the bathrooms, high-speed internet ports in all rooms, luxury Samsung oven, fully integrated designer Italian made kitchen, and induction hobs, and fully smart lighting (every room has multiple dimmers, all controllable via iphone or intelligent wall switches).",

    "experiences_offered": "none",
    "neighborhood_overview": "On one side we have Camberwell, which is incredibly for foodies with a cornucopia of great restaurants & welcoming pubs and friendly locals. On the other we have Peckham, which is one of the best night spots in town.",
    "notes": "Please note I have some lovely builders putting the finishing touches to the flat below. They are on the painting stage, so shouldn't make too much noise, but will be active normally from 9-6 for the next two weeks (scheduled to finish mid-October)",
    "transit": "If you're lucky enough / crazy enough to be travelling by car in London, you can park it in the road for free. Otherwise bikes and feet are the best way to navigate the local area, with 15-minute buses to take you to the nearest travel terminus (Elephant & Castle) if you're venturing into the centre of town to explore everything the city has to offer. Uber cabs are also a really great and pretty inexpensive option if buses aren't for you.",
    "access": "Please just make yourself at home. Feel free to use the laundry facilities, the bath, the lounge and the lovely designer Italian kitchen.",
    "interaction": "I've lived in London for nearly ten years now, so can claim to be an adopted Londoner! If you want insider tips on getting about town, what to see that's not on the tourist trail, where the locals go to drink, and where to get the best burgers or fish and chips, just let me know. I love sharing this local knowledge and meeting folk from around the world - and this is one of the reasons I'm so keen to Airbnb my spare rooms. I am out at work during the days, as an advertising exec, and am often out in the evenings, but when I'm around you'll find the atmosphere really warm and friendly.",
    "house_rules": "You're absolutely free to smoke in the garden, but please not in the room, the next guest probably won't thank you. Please save those Tina Turner renditions for London's karaoke bars, but otherwise feel free to treat the place as your home away from home.",

I love to laugh with old friends and make new ones. I love live music, good food, design, art and travel. I love to explore the city and travel the world whenever I can. I am also passionate about learning languages and have picked up French, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese along the way. \r\n\r\nOn my wide-ranging travels I have stayed at a lot of hostels and home stays and have always been able to muck in, make new friends and enjoy the vibe. I also have a regular stream of international friends coming to use my place as a base. As a host I look forward to giving something back to the international community.\r\n\r\n5 things I can't live without? Music. Books. Laughter. My camera. Oh, and great food!",

If you do not want to walk to the tube or back, the W4 bus goes from Turnpike Lane directly onto our road, and alternatively, if you are carrying lots of things, there is a cheap taxi station that can take you home for \u00a35. Otherwise Bruce Grove rail station (12-15 walk) leads directly through the hip areas of East London and goes to Liverpool Street within 20 min. Seven Sisters tube, on the Victoria Line, is also accessible though a bit further off. Otherwise there are plenty of buses close by that lead to various parts of the city.",

If the flat is available before, we're pretty flexible. For late arrival, please count an extra 25 euros for the cleaner's taxi back home. Departure  Before 11am, unless otherwise agreed in advance. In case of late departure, we still are pretty flexible :) Cleaning  Although we arrange for our cleaning lady to come and do a general clean after your departure, you are thus expected to leave the house relatively clean and in good order. We will handle the laundry, please leave all your bedsheets on the bed and towels in the bathroom, we'll take it from there. Safety deposit  Please note that there is a safety deposit of 500 GBP automatically handled by airbnb before arrival. They take an authorization on your credit card (not charged) and release it 48 hours after your exit, automatically, unless there is some damage in the flat. Easy, safe and convenient. Smo",

As someone who travels a lot I know how to create a space which works for a short term visit and feels luxurious. While you have access to all the basics such as towels, crisp ironed cotton sheets, shampoo and conditioner I also leave out other things for you to use. This includes a yoga mat and foam roller perfect for stretching out after travels. Cooking can help people feel at home - so I leave out lots of different condiments ingredients for you to cook",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The most obvious thing about the neighborhood is Finsbury Park with the flat looks directly over. You can cross the road into the park which has a free outdoor gym, a free bootcamp class on Saturdays, a boating lake, community garden and yoga in the park, tennis courts and basketball courts plus many other activities At the end of the road is the infamous Green Lanes, one of the longest streets in London which is particularly known for its delicious Turkish restaurants and food stalls.  20 minutes walk through the side streets takes you to the village like Crouch End with little restaurants and an Art House cinema built in a converted church.",
    "notes": null,
    "transit": "Really well connected with public transport to the whole of London:  Ten minutes walk from Manor House tube on the Piccadilly line which goes direct to Heathrow Airport, Kings Cross and Arsenal  Fifteen minutes walk to Finsbury Park tube which is on the Victoria Line getting you quickly to Euston, Kings Cross, Oxford Circus and many more places Eight minutes walk to Harringey Station with an overground serving Moorgate and Old Street Stations  Five minutes walk from Bus stop serving 29, 141 and 341 routes which take you to places such as Waterloo Bridge and Trafalgar Square",
    "access": "While in the space you are meant to feel at home so you have the whole place to yourself with access to all areas.",
    "interaction": "I do my best to be in to meet all guests when they arrive. When this isn't possible then I arrange another way of getting the keys to you. While I leave you to enjoy the space on your own I am always available to ask questions either about the flat or tips on how to enjoy your time in London.",

I'll do what I can to make sure you have a great stay. I am also independent and will give you space. \r\n\r\nMy life motto, I suppose, is to explore whenever you can inside and out, love when you can inside and out, play and laugh whenever you can wherever you are... and if you can't today- never mind you will again soon!",
